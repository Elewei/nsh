nsh//网络配置Shell//Chris Cappuccio <chris@nmedia.net> version 1.0

NSH is a CLI intended for OpenBSD-based network appliances. It replaces
ifconfig, sysctl and route with its own simple command language, and
encapsulates configuration for other daemons into one place, effectively
replacing /etc/netstart and parts of /etc/rc for appliance-style usage.

Daemons and services encapsulated by nsh:
pf, 
ospfd, 
ospf6d, 
bgpd, 
ripd, 
ldpd, 
relayd, 
ipsecctl, 
iked, 
rtadvd,
dvmrpd, 
sasyncd, 
dhcpd, 
snmpd, 
sshd, 
ntpd, 
ifstated, 
tftp-proxy, 
ftp-proxy,
tftpd, 
npppd, 
resolv.conf, 
inetd, 
smtpd, 
ldapd, 
ifstated
